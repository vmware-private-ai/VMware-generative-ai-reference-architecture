    "# Implementing a chatbot with Llama-2-13b-chat served by vLLM, through the Gradio UI\n",
    "- [**vLLM**](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.\n",
    "- [**Gradio**](https://www.gradio.app/) is a fast way to demo machine learning models with a friendly web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Please follow the instructions provided by the `README.md` file from the \n",
    "[LLM-fine-tuning-example](https://github.com/vmware-ai-labs/VMware-generative-ai-reference-architecture/tree/main/Examples/LLM-fine-tuning-example) directory to create a conda virtual environment with all the libraries used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Llama2 from the Transformers library you need to get approval from Meta and HuggingFace. \n",
    "- Please follow these [instructions provided by HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) before continuing.\n",
    "- Then [create a Hugging Face user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) to be able to download LLama 2 models from HF Hub.\n",
    "- Once you have created an access token, please log into the HuugingFace repository from the shell terminal using any of these options:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # Using an interactive command\n",
    "    huggingface-cli login\n",
    "  \n",
    "    # or using an environment variable\n",
    "    huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "You can serve Llama-2-13B-chat on an A100 (40GB) GPU using vLLM by running the following command:\n",
    "    `python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model=\"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you should be all set to get started!"

    "- Autumn (or Fall): Autumn starts in September and ends in November. During this season, the leaves on the trees start to change color and fall off, creating beautiful scenery. The weather can be a bit cooler, but it's still a great time to enjoy the outdoors.\n",
    "- Winter: Winter usually starts in December and ends in February. This is the coldest season of the year, with shorter days and less sunlight. It's a great time to cozy up indoors with a good book or a warm cup of tea.\n",
