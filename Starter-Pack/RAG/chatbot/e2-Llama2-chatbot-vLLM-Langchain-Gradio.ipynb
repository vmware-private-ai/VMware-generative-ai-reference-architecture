    "# Implementing a chatbot using LLama 2 chat (13B) served by vLLM using LangChain and the Gradio UI\n",
    "- [**Langchain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework for the fast prototyping of applications powered by language models. In this example we replaced the Gradio's chatbot memory with LangChain's memory implemented by the `LLMChain` class.\n",
    "- [**vLLM**](https://www.gradio.app/) is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving. In this example, we use LangChain's `VLLMOpenAI` class to access the vLLM OpenAI API-compatible service.\n",
    "- [**Gradio**](https://www.gradio.app/) is a fast way to demo machine learning models with a friendly web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Please follow the instructions provided by the README.md file from the \n",
    "[LLM-fine-tuning-example](https://github.com/vmware-ai-labs/VMware-generative-ai-reference-architecture/tree/main/Examples/LLM-fine-tuning-example) directory to create a conda virtual environment with all the libraries used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Llama2 from the Transformers library you need to get approval from Meta and HuggingFace. \n",
    "- Please follow these [instructions provided by HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) before continuing.\n",
    "- Then [create a Hugging Face user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) to be able to download LLama 2 models from HF Hub.\n",
    "- Once you have created an access token, please login from the shell terminal using any of these options:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # Using an interactive command\n",
    "    huggingface-cli login\n",
    "  \n",
    "    # or using an environment variable\n",
    "    huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "Now, you should be all set to get started!"
